# Chatroom-CNA

This project involved creating a chatroom and a basic online game which was synced via a network. The chatroom is able to parse private messages and send game 
requests to other users using commands built into the chatbox. A video of the project can be found at https://youtu.be/ozGsL-iCQuw
